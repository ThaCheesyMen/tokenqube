-- Comprehensive RLS policy fix for signup flow

-- First, let's check what policies exist and drop them all
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own transactions" ON transactions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own transactions" ON transactions;

-- Create comprehensive policies for profiles
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create comprehensive policies for transactions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own transactions"
  ON transactions FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own transactions"
  ON transactions FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Also ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
